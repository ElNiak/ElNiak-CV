Iâ€™m a cybersecurity researcher PhD student and teaching assistant at UCLouvain. Being a researcher allows me to not only develop autonomy and knowledge but also develop two tools improving security and analysis.

I have a computer science master degree (155 ECTS) in:

    software engineering,

    software & network security (mainly for transport and application layers)

    and AI (basic knowledge - ML/DL).

I love designing systems that are light yet powerful, not over engineered, distributed yet synchronized and beautiful yet effective.
